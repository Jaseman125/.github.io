These files are the content for my personal website.<br/>
index.html is the homepage that will load on devices which have less that 1900 pixel width screens.
index-wide.html is the homepage designed for computers with screens that are set to 1920 pixels width.
scroll.html is an easter egg file - in order to see this from the website you have to open index.html and then stretch it across two 1920 pixel width monitors and refresh the page.
The 'img' folder contains images that appear on the homepage and possibly on some of the sub pages as well.
