# JASEMAN.COM MAIN REPOSITORY
## Overview
These files are the content for my personal website.<br/>
index.html is the homepage that will load on devices which have less that 1900 pixel width screens (Phones mostly).<br/>
index-wide.html is the homepage designed for computers with screens that are set to 1920 pixels width (PCs, Laptops and possibly some tablets).<br/>
scroll.html is an easter egg file - in order to see this from the website you have to open index.html and then stretch it across two 1920 pixel width monitors and refresh the page.<br/>
The 'img' folder contains images that appear on the homepage and possibly on some of the sub pages as well.<br/>

## SUB-REPOSITORIES
There are several sub-repositories in my account (Branches from this one).<br/>
The reason I added these is in-case I fill up the storage.<br/>
Github allows 1 GB of storage maximum per repository.<br/>
The sub-repositories are:<br/>
https://jaseman125.github.io/lego/lego.html<br/>
https://jaseman125.github.io/music/music.html<br/>
https://jaseman125.github.io/movies/movies.html<br/>
https://jaseman125.github.io/photo-album/photos.html<br/>

## JASEMANCOM HOME PC
JASEMANCOM is the hostname of my gaming PC that I leave running 24/7 at home.<br/>
This PC used to host the website until I transferred it on 13th May 2025 (My 52nd Birthday).<br/>
Some of the content has not yet been imported into Github.<br/>
I have put links in the Git-hub pages to the older versions of the pages that still reside on JASEMANCOM.<br/>
Most of the content should be in Github soon - I'm actively working on this at the moment.<br/>
My home ISP (BT) do not provide me with a static IP and occassionally this changes.<br/>
When the public IP of my home router changes I will need to update any references to it in the HTML pages.<br/>
# MY CURRENT PUBLIC IP ADDRESS AT HOME:
## 109.180.239.72<br/>
